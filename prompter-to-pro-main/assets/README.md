## File Management

### Git LFS
Large video files are tracked using Git LFS (Large File Storage) to avoid bloating the repository.

If you need to add more videos:
1. Place them in this `assets` folder
2. Ensure Git LFS is installed
3. The `.gitattributes` file will automatically track them

### Alternative Hosting
If the video file is too large for GitHub:
- Upload to YouTube (unlisted)
- Use Vimeo
- Host on Google Drive
- Use GitHub Issues upload

See `VIDEO_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

## Notes

- Keep video files under 100MB if possible
- Compress videos before adding
- Use descriptive filenames
- Update this README when adding new assets
